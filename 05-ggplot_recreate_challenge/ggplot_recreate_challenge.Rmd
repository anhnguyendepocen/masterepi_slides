## *Exercise*

### The purpose of this exercise is to make a publication-ready plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills.
### Open the journal article "Riddell_Annals_Hom-Sui-Disparities.pdf". Read the abstract and have a look at Figure 3
###  The data you need is "CDC_Males.csv"
###  You'll have 1 hour to see what you can come up with in groups or individually!

---

## You got this.

### Don't worry about making it exactly, try and see how far you can get. 
### You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out.

## I'll leave these here

### You may need to use some `dplyr` skills from the first session
